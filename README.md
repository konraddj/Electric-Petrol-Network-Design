# Project Overview

## Description

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive network infrastructure for Electric-Petrol, focusing on their petrol station in Maynooth and integrating it with multiple other locations. The primary objective is to create a secure, reliable, and scalable network that connects the petrol station with two data centers and the company's headquarters.

## Project Components

1. **Local Network Design for Maynooth Petrol Station**
   - **Scope:** Develop the local area network (LAN) for the petrol station, covering physical and logical network layouts, equipment specifications, and cost estimates.
   - **Tools Used:** GNS3 emulator for network simulation and validation.
   - **Outcome:** A detailed LAN design and implementation plan tailored for the petrol station.

2. **WAN Design and Implementation**
   - **Scope:** Design and deploy a WAN solution to connect the Maynooth petrol station, data centers in Cork and Malin, and the headquarters in Skerries. This includes network routing, security, and redundancy planning.
   - **Tools Used:** FortiGate firewalls, IPsec VPNs, OSPF routing protocol, and SD-WAN technology.
   - **Outcome:** A robust WAN design ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient connectivity across all sites.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Local Network Design

   - **Tasks:**
     - Review the client’s building outlines and network requirements.
     - Assess network bandwidth needs, user counts, application types, and traffic characteristics.
   - **Outcome:** Comprehensive understanding of network needs and constraints.

2. **Network Design**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Develop a detailed plan for network distribution within the petrol station and inter-building connections.
     - Document physical and logical network architectures, including IP addressing, VLAN configurations, and device placements.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed design documents and equipment specifications.

3. **Simulation and Testing**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Simulate the network using GNS3 to validate design and performance.
     - Conduct functional, performance, security, and user acceptance tests.
   - **Outcome:** Verified network design ready for implementation.

### Phase 2: WAN Design and Implementation

1. **WAN Design and Costing**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Create a WAN solution to connect the petrol station, data centers, and headquarters.
     - Propose network infrastructure and equipment, including FortiGate firewalls, and estimate deployment costs.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed WAN design and cost estimates for the client.

2. **Security and Risk Management**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Implement PCI DSS compliance measures for secure payment processing.
     - Address risks related to hardware failures, cyber attacks, and natural disasters by applying security best practices and disaster recovery plans.
     - Configure FortiGate firewalls to manage network security, including secure remote access and VPNs.
   - **Outcome:** A secure WAN infrastructure with minimized risk factors and robust protection.

3. **Implementation and Testing**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Deploy the WAN solution, configure FortiGate firewalls, set up IPsec VPNs, and implement OSPF routing.
     - Perform performance and integration tests to ensure network reliability and security.
   - **Outcome:** A fully operational WAN network connecting all sites with secure and reliable connectivity.

## Conclusion

This project delivers a detailed and robust network solution that incorporates FortiGate firewalls for enhanced security, ensuring secure, reliable, and cost-effective connectivity across multiple sites. Through thorough planning, design, and testing phases, the project meets the client’s requirements and adheres to industry standards for network performance and security.
