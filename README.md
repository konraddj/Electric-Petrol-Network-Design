# Project Overview

## Description

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive network infrastructure for Electric-Petrol, focusing on their petrol station in Maynooth and integrating it with multiple other locations. The primary objective is to create a secure, reliable, and scalable network that connects the petrol station with two data centers and the company's headquarters.

## Project Components

1. **Local Network Design for Maynooth Petrol Station**
   - **Scope:** Develop the local area network (LAN) for the petrol station, covering physical and logical network layouts, equipment specifications, and cost estimates.
   - **Tools Used:** GNS3 emulator for network simulation and validation.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed LAN design and implementation plan tailored for the petrol station.

2. **WAN Design and Implementation**
   - **Scope:** Design and deploy a WAN solution to connect the petrol station, data centers in Cork and Malin, and the headquarters in Skerries. This includes network routing, security, and redundancy planning.
   - **Tools Used:** FortiGate firewalls, IPsec VPNs, OSPF routing protocol, and SD-WAN technology.
   - **Outcome:** A robust WAN design ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient connectivity across all sites.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Local Network Design and Validation

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Review clientâ€™s building outlines and network requirements.
     - Assess network bandwidth needs, user counts, application types, and traffic characteristics.
   - **Outcome:** Comprehensive understanding of network needs and constraints.

2. **Network Design**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Develop a detailed plan for network distribution within the petrol station and inter-building connections.
     - Document physical and logical network architectures, including IP addressing, VLAN configurations, and device placements.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed design documents and equipment specifications and BOM.

3. **Simulation and Testing**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Simulate the network using GNS3 to validate design and performance.
     - Conduct functional, performance, security, and user acceptance tests.
   - **Outcome:** Verified network design ready for implementation.

### Phase 2: WAN Design and Implementation

1. **WAN Design**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Create a WAN solution to connect the petrol station, data centers, and headquarters.
     - Propose network infrastructure and equipment, including FortiGate firewalls, and estimate deployment costs.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed WAN design and cost estimates for the client.

2. **Implementation and Testing**
   - **Tasks:**
     - Deploy the WAN solution, including FortiGate firewalls, IPsec VPNs, and OSPF routing.
     - Perform performance and integration tests to ensure network reliability and security.
   - **Outcome:** A fully operational WAN network connecting all sites with secure and reliable connectivity.

## Conclusion

The project delivers a comprehensive network solution for Electric-Petrol, integrating FortiGate firewalls to enhance security and ensure reliable, scalable connectivity across multiple sites. 

Additionally, it is recommended to implement further security and risk management measures to strengthen the overall network infrastructure. This includes:
- **PCI DSS Compliance:** Implementing measures for secure payment processing to meet industry standards. This applies to all network infrastructure elements, including servers, routers, cables, firewalls, etc.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to ensure ongoing compliance with PCI DSS requirements and to minimize the risk of data security breaches. Adhering to security standards is crucial to ensure that payment processing complies with legal requirements and to protect customer privacy.

These additional measures will provide enhanced protection and resilience, further ensuring the security and reliability of the network infrastructure.
