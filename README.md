# Project Overview

## Description

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive network infrastructure for Electric-Petrol, focusing on their petrol station in Maynooth and integrating it with multiple other locations. The primary objective is to create a secure, reliable, and scalable network that connects the petrol station with two data centers and the company's headquarters.

## Project Components

1. **Local Network Design for Maynooth Petrol Station**
   - **Scope:** Develop the local area network (LAN) for the petrol station, covering physical and logical network layouts, equipment specifications, and cost estimates.
   - **Tools Used:** GNS3 emulator for network simulation and validation.
   - **Outcome:** Detailed LAN design and implementation plan tailored for the petrol station.

2. **WAN Design and Implementation**
   - **Scope:** Design and deploy a WAN solution to connect the petrol station, data centers in Cork and Malin, and the headquarters in Skerries. This includes network routing, security, and redundancy planning.
   - **Tools Used:** FortiGate firewalls, IPsec VPNs, OSPF routing protocol, and SD-WAN technology.
   - **Outcome:** A robust WAN design ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient connectivity across all sites.
